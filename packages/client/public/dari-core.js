  var ANCHOR = { slug: 'dari-waxtide', name: '앵커 dari-waxtide', text: "STYLE ANCHOR - dari-waxtide   (Dari's lighthouse / wax crayon laid first, one sea-blue wash flooded after, on bright paper)\n\nStyle: wax crayon under a thin water wash on rough warm-white paper, for a child of four to six who is being read\n  to. 🔴 THE ORDER IS THE WHOLE METHOD: everything that will stay light is drawn FIRST in white wax, everything\n  that has a body is drawn in coloured wax, and THEN one blue wash is flooded over the page in a single wet pass.\n  The wash beads off the wax and soaks into bare paper. So nothing light was ever painted - foam, fog, rain, snow,\n  the lamp's beam, the lighthouse tower and the walls of the house are paper the wax kept dry. The wash is the only\n  wet thing, the wax the only drawn thing, and where wash met wax there is a granular bright edge, never a blend.\n\nRENDERING (finish hierarchy): everything on the page is one of three pressures of crayon.\n  PRESSED HARD = the child and whatever the page is about: opaque wax, so the wash beads off the whole shape and\n  leaves a pale halo of dry paper round it; inside the shape, DEEP marks - eyes, spots, nostrils, a buckle - 5 to\n  12 on a figure, 0 to 4 on a thing. RUBBED ON ITS SIDE = the place: one light rub per thing, so the wash catches in\n  the grain and speckles it - a table is one rub, a rock one rub, the hull one rub, 0 marks inside. NO CRAYON AT\n  ALL = sea, sky, night and weather: wash alone, in which the only drawing is white wax - crests, slants, dots,\n  rubs, and the beam.\n  🔴 THE WASH BEADS OFF A FIGURE AND OFF NOTHING ELSE - look for the dry halo and you have found who is on the\n  page. TWO FINISHED THINGS A PAGE, no more; each volume names its quiet spread in its own cut.\n  AT MOST: crests 24 · rain slants 24 · snow dots 20 · fog rubs 6 · beam wedges 2 · window squares 3 · stair treads\n  7 · shells 9 · bowls 4 · seaweed strips 12 · rope coils 3 · gulls other than Kkiruk 0.\n  🔴 FOG, SPRAY, STEAM AND BREATH ON GLASS ARE ONE THING: the white crayon on its side, rubbed, so the wash breaks\n  into speckle over it. That speckle is the only place wash and paper mix; it sits on top of something already\n  finished and never stands in for it.\n\nPALETTE (only these): PAPER #FBF6EA warm white - whatever the wax kept dry, the sun disc, and Kongal's whole\n  body · SEA #4F9BD0 the one wash, one pass - sky, water, shade ·\n  FUR #A8917A the one coloured crayon - seal fur, wood, rope, rock, the boat, the stove pot, a guest's coat · DEEP\n  #24486E the wash where it pooled or went over a third time - night, deep water, eyes, spots, the lamp-room iron,\n  the shadow under a rock; 🔴 DEEP IS NEVER A LINE ROUND A THING.\n  No white, black, grey, yellow or green paint exists: white is paper, black is DEEP, grey is FUR rubbed light,\n  yellow is the paper sun, and green is FUR rubbed light with the wash caught in its grain (seaweed, the vegetable\n  patch, a wet rock). THREE THINGS TOUCH THE PAPER - WHITE WAX, FUR WAX, SEA WASH - AND THE SHELL.\n  🔴 SHELL PINK #EE6B8D: across twenty-five books this colour exists on one object, the scallop shell on a string\n  round Dari's neck. Not a sunset, a crab, a shrimp, a flower, a guest's cloth, or any other shell (every other\n  shell is paper or FUR). Wherever Dari is, the shell is, and where it hangs says what she is doing: on the chest\n  (at ease), in the mouth (afraid or shy), swung round onto the back (running, sliding, swimming), hung on the\n  bedpost or the rim of the tub (asleep, bathing).\n\nSTAGE CLAUSES (one lighthouse and the house under it, twenty-five volumes):\n  🔴 TIME OF DAY = HOW MANY TIMES THE WASH WENT OVER. MORNING AND DAY: one pass, pale, the sky mostly paper; the\n    lamp is a paper disc and looks off. EVENING: two passes on sea and sky, and THE LAMP IS LIT - which means only\n    this: a wedge of paper runs from the lamp room across the washed sky, straight-edged, cut through whatever it\n    crosses. NIGHT: three passes, DEEP, and the wedge is the brightest thing; indoors a window is a DEEP square and\n    the wedge crosses it as a paper stripe. The house has no clock - the wedge is the clock.\n  🔴 WEATHER = THE SHAPE OF THE WHITE WAX STROKE UNDER THE WASH. CLEAR: crests only, short curls on the water, 6 to\n    24. FOG: the side of the crayon rubbed over sea and sky, 1 to 6 rubs, and nothing beyond the pier is drawn.\n    RAIN AND WIND: straight slants all leaning one way, 12 to 24, crossing wash only, never a figure. STORM (one\n    volume): slants 24, crests 24, three passes, no figure outdoors.\n    SNOW: dots at most 20, and the ground is paper edge to edge.\n  🔴 SEASON = HOW MUCH OF THE PAGE THE WASH COVERS AND WHAT HANGS ON THE LINE. SPRING: wash on the top third only,\n    the drying line empty. SUMMER: wash on two thirds, the sun a paper disc, the line hung with up to\n    12 seaweed strips. AUTUMN: wash on two thirds and slanted, the line hung and leaning. WINTER: wash on the top\n    third, the ground paper, the line empty, breath on glass rubbed.\n  KITCHEN - the walls are paper; table and bench FUR rubbed once; the stove a FUR pot with a paper mouth and no\n    flame drawn, and its door is closed on any page where Dari is nearer to it than her own length; bowls at most\n    4, seaweed in a bowl at most 3 strips.\n  BATHROOM - the tub a FUR half-barrel, its water one SEA patch with crests drawn before the wash; foam is paper;\n    toothbrush and soap FUR, the towel paper.\n  BEDROOM - one round window, a DEEP disc at night and paper by day; the quilt paper with a FUR edge; Kongal's\n    cradle FUR with one rocker; the small lantern a FUR frame round a paper square, the only lit thing on a page\n    where the lamp is out.\n  SPIRAL STAIR - treads FUR, 3 to 7 in view, always climbing to the right; a seal takes it on its belly one tread\n    at a time; a thing left on a tread is one FUR shape with a halo.\n  LAMP ROOM - glass all round: the panes are wash squares by night and paper by day; the lamp a paper disc in a\n    DEEP frame with one FUR brass handle; the rail FUR. Nobody is on the rail and the door to the gallery is shut.\n  PIER, ROCKS AND SAND - the pier three FUR planks; the boat FUR with a paper cabin, small enough to fit whole;\n    rocks FUR rubbed once with one DEEP shadow each; sand is paper; the water's edge is ONE crest the width of the\n    page, the only long white line there is.\n  🔴 THE LIGHTHOUSE - on the right edge of every outdoor page, a paper tower with ONE SEA band, its lamp room cut\n    off by the top edge unless the lamp is the event. It is the largest paper shape on any page it is on, and it\n    is never red.\n  🔴 GUESTS COME BY BOAT, from the left, one party a volume, and A GUEST IS KNOWN BY THE BOAT: on every page a\n    guest is on, the boat it came in is on the page too - moored at the pier, its prow at the page edge, or its\n    mast in a window. A guest's cloth is FUR or DEEP, never the accent. A guest never enters the water.\n\nCHARACTER DESIGN LANGUAGE: 🔴 HOW MUCH OF THE BELLY TOUCHES THE GROUND CARRIES THE FEELING - NOT THE FACE. A seal\n  is a bean that never changes its width; it only bends, and what it feels is which end comes off the ground: at\n  ease or pleased = both ends up, head and tail lifted, the belly touching in the middle only · curious or\n  listening = head up, tail down, touching from the middle back · sulky, sleepy or unwell = flat, the whole belly\n  down · playful = rolled over, the back on the ground, all four flippers up · afraid or shy = flat AND the shell\n  in the mouth. 🔴 DARI'S SIGNATURE IS THE TAIL FLIPPER FLICKED UP - the both-ends-up bend - and it closes every\n  volume.\n  EYES: two DEEP pools, each as wide as the two nostrils are apart, and that width is fixed for the whole series -\n  an eye is open or shut and nothing in between, no white, no pupil, no lid line; both shut = asleep and nothing\n  else. Whiskers are three white wax lines a side, seen only where they cross wash, and it is right that they\n  vanish indoors. The mouth is one short DEEP mark, never a smile arc.\n  GRADE: 🔴 SEALS DO NOT STAND. The belly is on the ground or on the tread; moving is a hop that lifts the middle;\n  nobody walks on flippers. 🔴 WHATEVER IS CARRIED IS CARRIED IN THE MOUTH - a\n  toothbrush, a spoon, a letter, a shell, the lantern's handle - OR HUGGED TO THE CHEST BETWEEN BOTH FORE-FLIPPERS -\n  a bowl, a bag, a lifejacket, Kongal. One flipper alone holds nothing and has no fingers; a buckle is pressed shut\n  between the two. IN WATER a seal is one curve and nothing else changes: the wash surrounds the body and its dry\n  halo is the water holding it up - a seal that is afraid in water is a straight stiff bean with no bend.\n  CLOTH ONLY WHEN IT RAINS: a FUR raincoat and hat with paper buttons; nothing else is ever worn but the shell.\n  🔴 THE CAST IS TOLD APART BY HEAD AGAINST BODY AND BY THE SNOUT, NOT BY SIZE: Dad's head is a fifth of his\n  length and his snout long and straight; Mom's head a fifth and her snout short and round; Dari's head a third of\n  her length; Kongal is a ball, the head half of everything. SPOTS ARE COUNTED: Dad 20, Mom 12, Dari 7, Kongal 0 -\n  Kongal has no FUR wax at all, paper with two DEEP eyes, the only paper body in the book.\n  KKIRUK the gull: paper body, DEEP wingtips and eye, a FUR beak; 🔴 NOTHING ON THE PAGE IS ABOVE KKIRUK - the\n  lamp-room roof, the rail, the mast, or the air, never the ground; talking is an open beak with nothing drawn\n  leaving it. A guest has the seals' eyes and marks and its own animal's way of moving.\n\nCANVAS: 16:9 double-page spread. 🔴 NO LETTERS, NUMERALS OR SIGNS ANYWHERE, the mail sack, the doctor's bag and\n  the inspector's notebook included. 🔴 ONE ISLAND, ONE MAP, TWENTY-FIVE BOOKS: the lighthouse on the right with the\n  house at its foot and Kkiruk's roof above, the stair spiralling up inside it, the pier and the boat at the left,\n  the rocks and the sand between, the vegetable patch and the drying line behind the house, the sea along the\n  bottom edge and out to the left. Any camera, never mirrored.\n\nNOT: no airbrush, no gradient, no glow or bloom round the lamp or the beam, no 3D render, no texture filter /\n  🔴 NO INVERTED SHAPE IN WATER OR GLASS - a reflection is one white crest / 🔴 NO FIGURE ON THE ROCKS OR IN THE\n  WATER WHILE A STORM OR NIGHT IS ON THE PAGE, no boat leaves the pier with a figure in it that has no lifejacket\n  hugged on, nobody on the gallery rail / no page fully washed: paper shows on every page.", award: "Ping-An Shih · Tai Chi" };
