  var ANCHOR = { slug: 'kota-mineral', name: '앵커 kota-mineral', text: "STYLE ANCHOR - kota-mineral   (Kota's hot-spring inn / opaque ground pigment, built up in passes)\n\nStyle: ground mineral pigment bound in warm glue and laid OPAQUE on a toned sized surface, for a\n  picture book read aloud to four- to six-year-olds. 🔴 NOTHING HERE IS FINISHED IN ONE PASS. Every\n  field is built by laying the same colour down again over itself - two passes for a far thing, four\n  or five for the thing the story is about - and the earlier passes are meant to show through the\n  last one as grain rather than be covered by it. 🔴 THE SUPPORT IS NEVER LEFT BARE: there is no\n  reserved white, no empty corner and no place where the paper is doing the work of light. If a\n  thing is pale it is pale BECAUSE IT WAS PAINTED PALE. Water thins nothing here.\n\nRENDERING (finish hierarchy): the dial of this book is GRIND, not brightness. One pigment is dark,\n  gritty and very slightly raised off the surface when ground coarse, and pale, smooth and dead flat\n  when ground fine, and the three steps of finish are read straight off that. (1) THE FIGURES AND\n  THE ONE THING THEY ARE TOUCHING - coarsest grind, four to five passes, and a thin dry ink contour\n  drawn first and still showing at the end. (2) THE PLACE THEY STAND IN - medium grind, two or three\n  passes, NO contour: a wall meets a floor because the two fields stop, not because a line says so.\n  (3) ANYTHING PAST THE EAVES, AND ALL STEAM - finest grind, one pass, no contour. 🔴 SO A FIGURE\n  CAN BE FOUND ON ANY GROUND IN THIS BOOK BY ONE TEST: it is the only thing on the page with a drawn\n  edge. 🔴 EVERY EDGE IS A CUT EDGE - grain lives inside a field and never at its border, and two\n  fields never blend into each other. AT MOST TWO THINGS ON A PAGE GET THE COARSEST GRIND.\n\nPALETTE (mineral, and there are only these): GROUND #C9BEA8, a warm clay tone that is painted on,\n  never bare · SHELL WHITE #EDE7DC for steam, wet-stone shine and the inn's towels - 🔴 THIS IS THE\n  LIGHTEST THING PERMITTED AND IT IS NOT WHITE; pure white appears nowhere, because a white mass of\n  steam swallows the one pink on the page · AZURE #3B5A72, deep and coarse, spent on night, water\n  and the father's robe · GREEN #6E8A6A · OCHRE #B98F52 for wood, straw and matting · BURNT EARTH\n  #8A4E3C for roof tile and hot stone · INK #2A2622 for every contour and every marking · 🔴 PEACH\n  PINK #E9A6A0, the one accent in twenty-five books, on Kota's neck towel and nowhere else ever -\n  not on a flower, not on a lantern, not on a guest. AT MOST FOUR OF THE MINERAL COLOURS ON ONE\n  PAGE, plus ink and shell white. The inn's own towels are shell white and plain, all of them.\n\nSTAGE CLAUSES\nPOT STEAM (2026-09-01) - the indoor no-steam rule is about WEATHER steam. Steam rising from a pot or a split bun IS the event of its book (07, 22) and is drawn — count its strands per page as the script says. (one inn and its yard; the place sets the grind and the number of steam passes):\n  🔴 STEAM IS COUNTED IN PASSES OF SHELL WHITE at the finest grind, laid over a field already\n    finished so that field still reads through it: a cold morning is four passes and the far side of\n    the valley goes under, an ordinary day is two, a rainy day is ONE and it lies low along the\n    ground instead of rising, and indoors there is none.\n  UPPER POOL — 🔴 THIS PLACE TAKES ONE MORE PASS OF STEAM THAN ANY LOWER PLACE DRAWN ON THE SAME PAGE. - hottest, highest up the slope. Stone here is burnt earth at the coarsest grind in the\n    book. Water is not transparent: one flat field of azure, and nothing under the surface is drawn.\n  LOWER POOL AND CHANNEL - the same water further down and cooler, so the same azure is ground finer\n    and paler and the steam is one pass or none. 🔴 THE CHANNEL RUNS DOWNHILL ACROSS THE PAGE AND\n    ITS FALL IS ALWAYS VISIBLE: a floating thing sits nearer the bottom edge of the page than the\n    place it went in. A stone in the channel is pale and dry on top, burnt earth where water reaches.\n  BOILING POOL - the pool at the head of the channel where things are cooked, the coarsest azure of\n    all and the most steam. Like the upper pool the water is not transparent, but 🔴 A THING PUT INTO\n    IT IS STILL DRAWN: lay the object as a flat shape and then ONE MORE PASS OF THE SAME AZURE OVER\n    IT, so it reads as a shape lying under a single skin of water, never as something seen through\n    depth. Nothing is blurred, softened or faded to show it is submerged - the extra pass is the only\n    signal, and a thing one pass under is as sharp-edged as a thing above the surface. The same rule\n    covers anything soaking in the channel. 🔴 A CHILD IS NEVER WITHIN ARM'S REACH OF THIS POOL:\n    what comes out of it comes out on the father's long ladle.\n  YARD - the widest place, ochre ground. When snow falls it is shell white over everything EXCEPT a\n    hand's width along the channel, which stays bare ochre.\n  CORRIDOR AND CHANGING FLOOR - wood indoors, ochre at medium grind with the grain running the\n    length of each board. 🔴 A WET BOARD IS THE SAME OCHRE WITH ONE PASS OF AZURE OVER IT and a hard\n    edge where the wet stops. Steam gathers high, so an upper shelf takes that same azure pass.\n  GUEST ROOM - the quietest page, matting in one flat ochre field with no grain at all. Night here\n    is azure at the coarsest grind over everything except the lamp's reach, and that reach is a\n    hard-edged shape, never a glow.\n\nCHARACTER DESIGN LANGUAGE: 🔴 A MARKING IS WHO SOMEBODY IS - NOT THE EYES. Every face carries flat\n  ink shapes laid down last, on top of a coat that is already finished, and those shapes do all the\n  work of feeling. For the raccoon dogs who keep this inn it is THE BAND ACROSS BOTH EYES: its\n  angle, its thickness and where its two ends stop are the whole expression of that page - it tilts\n  down at the outer ends and thickens when he is downcast, thins and lifts at the outer ends when he\n  is pleased, and breaks into two short pieces when he is startled. THE EYE INSIDE THE BAND IS FIXED\n  FOREVER - one small round opening of shell white with an ink centre, the same size on every page\n  of twenty-five books, open or shut. THERE ARE ONLY THREE INK MARKINGS ON A RACCOON DOG AND NEVER A\n  FOURTH: the eye band, the dark forehands, the ringed tail.\n  A COAT IS A BUILT FIELD AND NOT HAIR - no hair strokes, no whisker lines, no drawn fur edge, no\n  drawn folds in cloth. The coat ends where the field ends.\n  GRADE: everyone here stands upright, wears cloth and has hands, guests included whatever animal a\n  guest happens to be. 🔴 A GUEST HAS NO EYE BAND: each guest species is given ONE flat ink shape of\n  its own on the face instead, in ink and never in colour.\n  🔴 HOUSE OR ROAD, READ OFF THE OUTLINE: the two who live here WEAR cloth that is not clothing -\n  the child a towel at the neck, the father a folded towel at the waist - and carry nothing. A guest\n  wears no cloth at neck or waist and instead has ONE travelling thing on the outline: a bundle on\n  the back, a wide hat, a stick, a basket. A house towel in a guest's hands is carried, not worn.\n  🔴 AN ADULT IS NOT A BIGGER CHILD: an adult's robe closes at mid-calf so no shin is ever seen and\n  the sleeves hang past the hands, a child's stops above the knee with both shins bare. Height never\n  tells two figures apart.\n\nCANVAS: 16:9 double-page spread. 🔴 NOT ONE WRITTEN MARK ANYWHERE - the door curtains, lanterns,\n  towels, wooden tags and paper doors of this inn are all blank: no writing, no numerals, no crest.\n\nNOT: no airbrush, no soft gradient, no glow, no 3D render / 🔴 NO FIRE ANYWHERE IN THIS BOOK - no\n  hearth, no stove, no lit wood,\n  no flame, no smoke: this water is hot because it comes out of the ground / 🔴 THE CHILD IS NEVER\n  IN THE WATER - his hands and his feet only, and only at the lower pool and the channel edge; hot\n  water is carried and poured by the adult on every page where it moves / a slip lands sitting on\n  the floor, never head first and never on a stair.", award: "Wang Zumin · 噔噔噔 (Thump!

It is the only pink anywhere in twenty-five books.\nFEET: 🔴 RAISED WOODEN SANDALS - two blocks under each sole, so THERE IS A GAP OF DAYLIGHT BETWEEN\n  HIS FOOT AND THE GROUND.
